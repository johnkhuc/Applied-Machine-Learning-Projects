## Installation
The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive computing. 
You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install notebook

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).
